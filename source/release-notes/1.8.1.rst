Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time. 

Release Highlights
=====================

* :jirabug:`PBM-871` - Fixed the restore failure on a different cluster. Now the UUID of users and system collections are not preserved when replaying the oplog. 
* :jirabug:`PBM-881` - The |PITR| chunks display is now consistent in both ``pbm status`` and ``pbm list`` outputs. 

.. |PITR| replace:: :abbr:`PITR (Point-in-time recovery)`
