*Percona Backup for MongoDB* 1.8.0 (2022-06-09)
================================================================================

:Date: June 9, 2022
:Installation: `Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-backup-mongodb/installation.html>`_

Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB
sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups
across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a single replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time. 

Release Highlights
==================

* Ability to :ref:`restore data to a replica set with a different name and configuration <pbm.restore-new-env>`. This extends the list of environments compatible for the restore.
* When you use EBS-snapshots or other tools for physical backups, you :ref:`no longer have to create a mandatory base backup snapshot in |Percona Backup for MongoDB| as the starting point for Point-in-Time Recovery oplog slicing <pitr-oplog-only>`. This reduces time and effort on managing excessive backups and makes |PITR| from physical or storage-level backups more straightforward.
* The ability to wait for the backup operation to finish before doing further actions through the session lock. This simplifies the automation of operations with |PBM|.
* Ability to define backup compression level and method in |PBM| configuration.  
* To simplify the |PBM| configuration, the example configuration file is now included in the |PBM| package. 


New Features
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-776`: Allow data restore into the replica set with a different name
* :jirabug:`PBM-866`: Add the ability to wait for the backup operation to finish and print the result
* :jirabug:`PBM-782`: Allow saving |PITR| oplog  without base snapshot
* :jirabug:`PBM-838`: Add the ability to configure default compression method and level for backups



Improvements
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-828`: Add the full reference configuration file to packages
* :jirabug:`PBM-751`: Format timestamps according to `RFC3339 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339>`_ (Thanks to Damiano Albani for reporting this issue)



Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PBM-820`: Fix a bug where PBM crashed if backup cancelled right after it started by cancelling the backup gracefully
